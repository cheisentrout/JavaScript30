  - Duplicate the h1 text
  - Apply different colors to the mobile h1s
  - Create motion ranges for the moving h1s
  - Make sure the h1s freeze in place when we move our mouse off the page, 
    and pick up where we left off when we move it back on.
  - Colors of the h1s will need transparency when they intersect with one another.

    is on the page.*/

    on the hero div - but the div's child elements will log their own values of x and y (AKA, the
    top left corner of the h1 will have small x/y values just like the top left corner of the
    div does.) So, we need to add the values of the event's x and y values to any element that isn't

    and multiply that number by the walk range (100px). Then, subtract the walk range divied by 2 -
    this will be 50". This is because, although our walk range is 100px total, that means we want the
    option to go either 50px forward, or 50px BACKWARDS. We don't just want the shadow to move towards
    the bottom right, we want it to have the option to flex 50px foward and 50px backward, for a range of
    -50 - +50, or 100px of movement range total. */
