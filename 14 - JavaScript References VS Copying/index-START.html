      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2); //output: 100 100
      age2 = 200;
      console.log(age, age2); //output: 100 200
      /* We begin by setting "age" to 100, then we create a variable 
      called "age2" that stores the value of "age". If we log the values of
      both variables, we get identical numbers. If we continue down the program
      and edit the value of "age2", and log the two variables again (age, age2),
      age2 will change without affecting the value of its reference, "age". */
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team); //output: ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"] ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //team[3] = "Lux"; 

    // however what happens when we update that array?
      //we get an output of ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"] for both "players" and "team"
      /* This is because the "team" variable is a REFERENCE to the "players" array. 
      Although you can use this strategy with numbers, booleans, and strings to update
      variables, it will mutate an original array rather than creating a new copy you can tweak. */

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //This takes each element out of the players array and "spreads" them into a new array
    team4[3] = "Madison"; 
    console.log(team4)//output: ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Madison'] -- does NOT change the "players" array!
    
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Stony";
    console.log(team5); //output: ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Stony'] -- again, does NOT change "players" array!
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const blizzard = {
      size: 'medium',
      flavor: 'vanilla'
    }

    const withCandy = Object.assign({}, blizzard, { candy: 'm&ms' });
    console.log(withCandy);
    /* ABOVE: create a new variable to store your copied object with added properties.
    Call Object.assign(). Within its parentheses, put an empty pair of curly braces, the
    object you're creating an instance of, and within another set of curly braces, add the
    key-value pairs for your object instance. */


    // and think we make a copy:


    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const clare = {
        name: 'Clare',
        age: 30,
        student: true,
        faveFoods: {
          breakfast: 'smoothie',
          lunch: 'leftovers',
          dinner: 'squash soup'
        }
      };

      const grumpy = Object.assign({}, clare);
      grumpy.faveFoods.breakfast = 'chocolate';
      grumpy.faveFoods.lunch = 'cheez-its';
      grumpy.faveFoods.dinner = 'macaroni & cheese'; /* SURPRISE! This mutates the original
      "clare" object, because Object.assign() is "shallow", and can only address the first
      level of properties within an object. You could edit name, age, and student in grumpy
      without mutating the OG object, but not the second level of prorpeties in faveFoods.

      apparently using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(clare)) is an option to turn "clare" into a string,
      then immediately back into an object copy which you can edit all levels of without affecting
      "clare".
