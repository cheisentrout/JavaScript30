  /* Whenever someone pushes one of the keys, we need to push it into an array. Here are my pseudocode thoughts on how to do that!
  1. create an empty array
      const letterArray = [];
  2. Inside the function of the window event listener, it'll be something like:
      letterArray.push();
      Will we need a variable for the pushed keys?
      Will we need a "forEach()", or can we not start there because there's no
      array to start with?
  3. Then we'll write an if/else statement that states something like:
      if (letterArray === ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b']) {
        function that resets the webpage or reveals the secret content or whatever
      } else { nothing };
